#Â Fleet Manager Extension

This web-extension allows you to upload you fleet from the RSI hangar directly to https://fleet-manager.space.

Available for Firefox and Chrome.

Planned features:

- Instead of push a button to upload your fleet, we will add a "diff" system that directly updates your fleet on Fleet Manager if it has changed. Of course, it effects when you are on RSI hangar. This feature will be deactivable on Fleet Manager.
